        <p><strong>My Biggest Academic Achievement</strong></p>
<p>To be honest, when I saw this topic, I couldn’t think of anything to write about… After a few minutes , I thought that the improvement in my chemistry grade might be a kind of academic achievement. </p>
<p>After entering senior high school, I found that the way of  studying was very different from that in junior high school, especially in the international department which has a different style of teaching and learning from those in China. In junior high school, I got most of my knowledge from  teachers giving me information, while in senior high school students have to do lots of research themselves. You may wonder why I wanted to write about on studying style first. The reason is that interest is often piqued when people are curious  and find answers for themselves. I often  had no fun  studying at junior high school in the past. It was like study was “dead”. The change in studying and teaching methods made a large contribution to the improvement in my chemistry grade. </p>
<p>   Before studying  in senior high school , some teachers told me that chemistry would be the most difficult subject in “CAIE”. I found this was true when I gradually learned more about chemistry at school. It was not only vocabulary, but also there was a lot that we hadn’t covered in junior high school. As a result, I spent much more time on studying chemistry than other subjects which were easier. In my opinion, I have a good habit of researching everything that I don’t understand. According to research, academic achievement is essential because “It also allows students to enter competitive fields. Academic achievement is often a sign of a refined intellect, which can help students in all areas of their lives.” (<a href="http://www.reference.com/world-view/academic-achievement-important-f5caf6e19dec7100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.reference.com/world-view/academic-achievement-important-f5caf6e19dec7100</a>, 无日期)</p>
<p>There was a large amount of free time after school, and I often used that  time to discuss things I didn’t ’ understand when in class with a teacher, or sometimes with my friends. I also went to the laboratory to do some experiments in order to better understand information from class or questions. </p>
<p>What is also essential is that I found chemistry was very interesting stuff, as it can explain the behavior of every substance in our life like why glass has a higher boiling point than metal, why acid rain has an effect on buildings and so on. Improvements were made gradually as I acquired knowledge in this way. As expected, I got high marks in nearly every exam. For instance, I got 91% in chemistry which is the third highest mark in my class, my teacher also gave me a good assess. Also, I gradually find that more classmates come and ask me for chemistry questions which makes me more confident about this subject. </p>
<p>In conclusion, I think it is good to study in this way and I am also lucky to have  the  opportunity to study. In the future, hopefully I can find more subjects which interest me. </p>
