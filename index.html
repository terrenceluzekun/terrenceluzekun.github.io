        <p>​    Last week, I took part in a salon about computer industry. To be honest, I was a bit nervous because I am unfamiliar with computer. To my surprise, I still understood some points of the speech. Here is some information that I recorded, including my own understanding. </p>
<p>​    First part is Basic situation and characteristics of the industry, this industry is divided by hardware (The server), software (APPs) and service. New technology, which is cloud computing provides new applications like cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. Second part is Basic framework of industry analysis, including typical business model of the industry and judgment on the core competitiveness of the company. Third part is things need to be avoided in this industry, while there are still some weaknesses in computing so money loss is a serious problem.</p>
<p>​    After the salon, I have several feelings, firstly, many industries nowadays need computing technology, indicating that on-line working is becoming more and more popular now. I can also find workings are becoming faster and more automated. </p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>​         As we all know, a whole new way for shopping has become very popular for 3 years since 2017 which is purchasing goods on-line on different platforms like “taobao” (china Alibaba). The process of buying is quite easy, firstly choosing goods you want and then you either put in shopping cart to think again before decision or buy them now. Next, pay for the good through “Alipay” (an APP for paying on-line), also, your house address and cell phone number are needed for courier to deliver your goods to you. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/05/28/tevGEn.png" alt="tevGEn.png"></p>
<p>​     This is a graph for change in proportion of on-line purchasing revenue in total sale revenue. Indicating that on-line shopping is more welcomed in China. </p>
<p>​      Both pros and cons exist. Obviously, this way for purchasing is more convenient than traditional one because everything can be done at home. Also, prices of commodities are relatively cheap on-line while on-line shops don’t need to pay shop rents. Disadvantages like time lag and real quality, for instant, sizes of clothes may not be suitable for consumers sometimes. These are unknown when shopping on-line. </p>
<p>​      The main thing I want to mention is the brand new sales promotion. In the past, brands advertised their products through celebrity endorsement and putting publicity photos on the wall of street or inside shopping mall to arouse consumers’ interest. However, with short video APP (like Tik Tok) and live stream being more and more popular nowadays, different ways of promotion arise. </p>
<p>​      Firstly, short video platforms create some internet celebrities which have large number of fans on those platforms, thus they have commercial value. They can endorse for commodities of grands in short videos because many people pay attention on these celebrities and maybe more people would purchase goods after watching. Secondly, some people promote goods through live stream. These people promote commodities through using them lively and give some opinions after using, which make consumers feeling closer to product itself when others are using it. Usually, there is link of commodity on “Taobao” and consumers can click the link to purchase goods at any time. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/05/28/tejLnJ.png" alt="tejLnJ.png"></p>
<p>​      This is a graph showing the trend of scale of live stream market and proportion of revenue. We can see that revenue made from live stream proportion is increasing. </p>
<p>​      </p>
<p>​      In conclusion, improvement of on-line shopping revenue and different ways of promotion all represent progress of technology and changes of purchasing habits of consumers in China. For me, I prefer on-line shopping because of low prices, also, I don’t need to concern about quality of goods because I would be clear about it through live stream or short videos. However, unemployment should be concerned while decreasing number of people choose to buy commodities in shopping mall, when firms get less revenue, some labors will be fired. </p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>  As I mentioned in past diary, I began to study python few months ago. After some contact in python, I found there are really lots of functions not only help programmers to make editing codes much easier, but also help people in daily life. For instance, I have studied how to draw graphs on python through codes. After the lesson, I wondered whether this function could draw some mathematics’ graphs and help me understand questions in Maths more easily. Finally, I found python can do it !</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/04/18/JnZN5Q.png" alt="JnZN5Q.png"></p>
<p>Here are some brief explanations, </p>
<p>Firstly, in order to decrease time for coding, I shrink the language “numpy” and “matplotlib” into “np” and “plt” seperately by importing them. Next, “plt.figure()” is used to plot a diagram with basic axises as a background. </p>
<p>Secondly, as I want two diagrams appearing together, I marked each diagram as a subplot. Then, here are some explanations of (2,1,1) and (2,1,2), the number on left represents number of rows, there are two diagrams and they are on two lines. Middle number represents number of column while there is only one column. Right one is the identifier of graph so “1” for first graph and “2” for the rest one obviously. </p>
<p>Finally, we just need to write codes in the form of “plt.subplot” while sin(x) and cos(x) are functions in “numpy” language so we use “np.()” to derive these two functions. </p>

        <p>Up-to-date Economic phenomenon and my own feelings</p>
<p> Currently, the Novel coronavirus pneumonia (called disease in rest of the article) is spreading around the world. When the people around the world are taking action to guard against the disease, I find that the economic condition is changing significantly.</p>
<p> Firstly, some countries’ governments ask citizens not to go to work and students not to go to school in a period of time because of preventing further spreading of disease. In this case, industries can no longer produce goods and services, countries with tourism as main industry will not achieve tourists in few months and so on. Leading to aggregate supply and aggregate demand (like raw materials) decreasing. Also, in my opinion, the demand for products of people falls as well to basic goods like food and daily necessity in this special period. Upon factors can all lead to decrease in GDP (gross domestic production), which is a serious problem that may lead to recession around the world. These are just my ideas. Moreover, several evidences prove that my opinions may be right. Price of raw materials like oil decreases sharply in stock market, maybe because the demand for oil decreases.</p>
<p> In my expectation, some countries take actions to prevent the recession locally. I was very impressed of actions taken by America, which is reducing interest rate to 0. I think it is an incredible number because that nearly means preventing citizens from saving money but to borrowing money from banks. In my learning knowledge, reducing dealing with interest rate is monetary policy controlled by central bank. In this period of time, I think the action of America is obvious, which is using expansionary monetary policy to stimulate and resume economy locally because people will borrow my money, thus the purchasing power increases and consumption increases. Demand increasing may prevent economy from recession. This is interesting.</p>
<p> The facts above are from newspapers or observation on stock market while the impacts and reasons for imposing policies are all my own opinions. Lastly, I hope that the human can solve the problem of disease as soon as possible and everything will return to normal soon! </p>

        <p> Event: In this winter holiday, I took part in Future Business Leaders of America(FBLA). This competition is divided by two parts, team work and personal exam. There people can build up as a team. Our team’s topic is global business which include knowledge from micro part to macro part. For example, from mangement of factors of production in a company, which is micro, to the production of all kinds of goods and services in each firm and transaction in the whole market relating to demand and supply. Moreover, personal exam includes many different exams with different topics. I chose two topics which are insurance&amp;risk management and business communication. The exam gave us some paragraphs relating to knowledge in exams, candidates should read the paragraphs and finish exams with their own knowledge accumulation as well.</p>
<p>Feelings: From team work, I deeply felt the impotance of cooperation. If all team members do the same thing together, there may be no enough time for us to finish the team work. Meaning that every member should choose several topics that they are good at to be finished in order to reach high efficiency. Also, trust among teammates is essential. From personal exams, I found that there is still large amount of economic konwledge waiting me to explore. In addition, the presentation ability and vocabulary need to be improved. </p>
<p>Move on and study hard !</p>

        <p>A couple of days later, I will get part in Python studying. I have researched on the internet that Python is a language for computer designing. To be honest, I am not good at knowledge relating to computer so that I think Python studying will be complicated for me. My tutor told me that Python is useful for further study abroad because computer and internet are wildly used by foreigners to learn, such as handing in homework, taking classes and so on. Also, a few weeks ago, I learned how to use “github” which is a blog being used to share your articles on this platform. To my surprise, This Python study will be related to the use of “github”, which makes me feel better because I could use some knowledge that I was touched. From this, I think the computer study is separated by different parts and some of the parts have inter-relation. This is interesting.   </p>
